# Private School - Static Front End

This project provides a static front end implementation of the previously developped [Private School Java](https://github.com/nikossyr/PrivateSchoolStructureDBConnection) project. 

There is no actual functionality as database and server connection but it is navigationally adequate and provide add, edit, delete actions only for the current page lifecycle in browser.
